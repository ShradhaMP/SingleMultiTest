# README for Workflow Automation Application

## Overview
This application provides a set of workflows designed to automate various processes. Each workflow consists of a series of steps that define the logic and transitions necessary to achieve specific tasks. The workflows are structured to facilitate easy integration with external systems and APIs.

## Process Steps / Features
- **New Workflow**:
  - **Select Trigger**: Initiates the workflow based on an event source.
  - **End**: Marks the completion of the workflow.
  
- **New Workflow 1**:
  - **Select Trigger**: Similar to the previous workflow, it starts the process.
  - **End**: Concludes the workflow.

- **New Workflow_1**:
  - **Response**: Handles responses from external services.
  - **RESTService**: Fetches data from a specified REST endpoint.
  - **Lookup**: Performs lookups based on predefined tables.
  - **End**: Finalizes the workflow.

- **New Workflow_1_1**:
  - **RESTService**: Retrieves data from a REST API.
  - **DataTableInsert**: Inserts data into a specified data table.
  - **End**: Ends the workflow.

## Installation Steps
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.
- Configure environment variables as required by the workflows.
- Deploy the workflows to your automation platform.

## Integration Details
- The workflows integrate with REST APIs, specifically using the `GET` method to retrieve data.
- They utilize event sources to trigger actions based on specific events.
- The workflows can interact with data tables for data storage and retrieval.

## Setup & Configuration
- Each workflow requires configuration of the event source and endpoints.
- Ensure that the necessary permissions and authentication tokens are set up for API access.
- Configure any required parameters for the REST services, such as path parameters.

## API Details
- **RESTService Endpoint**: 
  - **Method**: GET
  - **Path**: `/test/{id}`
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `id` (number): The identifier for the resource being fetched.
  - **Headers**: Ensure to include any required authentication headers.

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting
- For workflows located in the `Tests` folder, ensure that all test cases are executed to validate the logic.
- Monitor logs for any errors during the execution of workflows, especially during API calls.
- If a workflow fails, check the configuration of the event sources and API endpoints for accuracy.

## Folder Structure
**Common**: Stores shared utilities, reusable components, or common authentication and integration processes.
**Event**: Handles event-driven processes, such as job scheduling, webhook triggers, or data pipeline events.
**Process**: Houses different processes related to employee data handling and business workflows.
**Test**: Contains test workflows for validation and debugging.
**Upsert**: Handles inserting and updating records or APIs.
