# README for Workflow Automation Application

## Overview
This application facilitates the creation and management of automated workflows. Users can define triggers and transitions between steps, allowing for streamlined processes in various tasks. The application currently supports basic workflows with a start and end step.

## Steps: Features
- **Select Trigger**: Initiates the workflow based on specified events.
- **End**: Marks the completion of the workflow.

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using your package manager (e.g., `npm install`).
3. Configure the application by setting up the required resources, ensuring that the `activityGroup`, `activityName`, and `activityType` are defined.

## Integration Details
- The application integrates with various event sources to trigger workflows.
- Users can define multiple workflows, each with its own set of triggers and transitions.

## Setup & Configuration
- Define resources in the application to specify how data is handled.
- Ensure that the configuration includes necessary parameters such as `authType`, `accountName`, and `accountKey` for secure access.

## API Details
- The application does not expose specific API endpoints in the provided data. However, workflows can be triggered programmatically based on defined events.

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting
- Errors are managed through the workflow transitions, allowing for graceful handling of unexpected events.
- Users should ensure that all steps are properly configured to avoid workflow failures.
